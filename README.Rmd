# eq5d.plus

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of eq5d.plus is to run linear models on EQ-5D quality of life data that uses both the score and visual analogue scale (VAS).

## Installation

You can install the released version of eq5d.plus from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# Install devtools from CRAN
install.packages("devtools")

# Install latest version from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("agbarnett/lmvas")
```


## Example

This example runs a linear model with independent variables of age and sex:

```{r example}
library(eq5d.plus)
## example using the Spanish osteoarthritis data
model = res = lmvas(vas_name='EQ5D_VAS', eq_name='EQ5D', independent_vars = c('age','sex'), data=arthritis)
summary(model)
```

The results show a reduced intercept for the VAS compared with the score of `r round(model$summary.fixed$mean[2]*1000)/1000`. 
Quality of life is lower on averaged for women and for older respondents.

The score and VAS are positively correlated with an estimated correlation of `r round(model$summary.hyperpar$mean[4]*1000)/1000`.
